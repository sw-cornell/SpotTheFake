Cornell Tech,Yogesh Sakhardande,5,"Cornell Tech campus tour on Roosevelt Island is just a lobby visit of the Bloomberg and Tata Innovation center buildings. You cannot visit classrooms. You get to see the lobby cafe. Save yourself a trip, view the pictures attached. Take the ferry from Manhattan if you have to visit in person.
